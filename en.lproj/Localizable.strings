There are many versions of ##Bánh Mì## (sandwich); the traditional ##Bánh Mì## (sandwich) is typically made with cold cuts along with mayo or liver pâté, but ##Thịt Nướng## (grilled pork) is also very popular. What makes ##Bánh Mì## (sandwich) unique though is not just the meat and spread, but the iconic ##Đồ Chua## (pickled carrot and daikon). It gives ##Bánh Mì## (sandwich) a sweet and tangy flavor that, along with some fresh cucumber, cilantro, and jalapeño, make ##Bánh Mì## (sandwich) a great food item to be enjoyed any time of the day.";
